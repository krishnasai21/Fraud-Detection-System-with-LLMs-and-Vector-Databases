# Fraud-Detection-System-with-LLMs-and-Vector-Databases
Developed a fraud detection system that leverages LLM embeddings and transformer models to analyze transaction descriptions, detect anomalies, and flag potential fraudulent activities. Integrate the solution with a vector database to perform similarity search for rapid anomaly identification.
